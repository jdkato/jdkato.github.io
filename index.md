### Education

I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/math/bsba-in-mathematics) (2012 - 2016; GPA: 3.81 / 4.00). My areas of interests are numerical analysis and statistics&mdash;some of my most relevant courses are Applied Linear Algebra ([MTH 343](http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Bulletin/Courses/Mth-Mathematical-Sciences/300/Mth-343)), Numerical Calculus ([MTH 451 - 452](http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Bulletin/Courses/Mth-Mathematical-Sciences/400/Mth-451)), Applied Statistics ([STAT 451 - 452](http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Bulletin/Courses/Stat-Statistics/400/Stat-451)), and Mathematical Statistics ([STAT 461](http://pdx.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Bulletin/Courses/Stat-Statistics/400/Stat-461)).

I took a number of computer science credits as well (one course shy of a minor, in fact), including Introduction to Operating Systems ([CS 333](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/cs333)), Elements Of Software Engineering ([CS 300](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/cs300)), and Data Structures ([CS 163](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/cs163)). I also took [Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications](http://codingthematrix.com/) and [Web Application Architectures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-app) through Coursera.
